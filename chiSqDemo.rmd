##If X1,X2,.,Xm are m independent random variables having the standard normal distribution, then the following quantity follows a Chi-Squared distribution with m degrees of freedom. Its mean is m, and its variance is 2m.

## $V = X1^2 + X2^2 + ... +Xm^2$   

##Here is a graph of the Chi-Squared distribution 7 degrees of freedom.

```{r}
num=70000
x=rnorm(num) ## generate random standard normal numbers
x2=x^2
dim(x2)=c(10000,7) ## organize the squares into a 10000 by 7 matrix
z=apply(x2,1,sum)  ## get the sums of the rows
hist(z)
plot(density(z),main="sum of squares of 7 random samples")
px=seq(from=0,to=30,by=.02)
py=dchisq(px,df=7)
lines(px,py,col="blue")  #plot chi squared function in blue
mean(z)
var(z)
```

##Many statistics follow a chi-squared distribution
